## <a name="modules"></a> Modules

Elixir uses the concept of modules for grouping several functions together. Functions, other than anonymous functions, cannot be declared outside the scope of a module. We introduce the modules here very briefly and return to them when we start building something more complex. 

```elixir
iex> defmodule Math do 
...>  def square(a) do
...>    a * a
...>  end
...>end

iex> Math.square(2)
4
```

A module can be declared using the `iex` interpreter, or by saving the contents of the module to a file with the `.ex` extension by convention. Modules declared in separate files should be compiled with the `elixirc` compiler

``` elixir
defmodule <module_name> do
  # Module body
end
```

The module definition follows the format `defmodule` module name `do` ... module body ... `end`. Functions within a module are defined with the `def` macro and private functions visible only within the lexical scope of the module use the `defp` macro. 

``` elixir
def function_name(param_a, param_b) do
  # Function body
end
```

Both public and private functions follow the structure `def` fn_name(params..) `do` ... function body ... `end`

```elixir
def square(a) do
  a * a
end
```
<div class="key-concept">
<a name="implicit_return_values"></a> <span>Implicit return values</span>
![Key concept][lambda] <p>It is also worth noticing, that the function `square/1` does not have an explicit `return` statement or similar, like imperative languages such as Java or C tend to use. </p>

<p>This is a common feature in functional languages. The function body is an expression, and the last evaluated value in the function body is treated as the function's return value.</p>
</div>

```elixir
defmodule Math do
  def square(a) do
    a * a
  end
end
```

Create a new file called `math.ex` and save the contents above inside the file.

```bash
$ elixirc math.ex
```

When the module is defined in it's own file, the module can be compiled with the `elixirc` command followed by the filename. The bytecode resulting from the compilation of our example can be found from the file `Elixir.Math.beam` 

```elixir
iex> Math.square(2)
4
```

When executing the `iex` REPL in the same directory the compiled file is stored in, the module is automatically available for the Elixir interpreter. 

## <a name="functions"></a> Functions
### <a name="first_class_citizens"></a>  Functions as first-class citizens
<div class="key-concept">
 ![Key concept][lambda]<span>Functions are first-class citizens</span>
 <p>Extensive use and composition of short, single purpose functions is one of the distinguishing properties of functional programming. Functions are first class citizens in functional programming: functions are acceptable parameters for functions, functions can be anonymous or named, assigned to variables, stored in data structures and functions can return functions as their return values.</p>

<p>In other words, function is a value with the type function, which when evaluated, reduces to the return value generated by the expression captured by the function. </p>
</div>

```elixir
defmodule Temperature do
  def fahrenheit_to_celsius(t) do
    (t - 32) * 5/9
  end

  def celsius_to_fahrenheit(t) do
    t * 9/5 + 32
  end

  def celsius_to_kelvin(t) do
     273.15 + t
  end

  def kelvin_to_celsius(t) do
    t + 273.15
  end

  def kelvin_to_fahrenheit(t) do
    celsius_to_fahrenheit(kelvin_to_celsius(t))
  end

  def fahrenheit_to_kelvin(t) do
    celsius_to_kelvin(fahrenheit_to_celsius(t))
  end
end
```

The above is an example of the module `Temperature` which consists of conversion functions between temperatures reported in celsius, kelvin and fahrenheit. The functions do not have an explicit return statement, instead the functions return the value the expression representing the function body evaluates to. In this case, the expressions of the functions evaluate to the result of the calculation declared in the function body. 

```elixir
defmodule PersonOps do
  def print_age(p) do
    IO.puts("The person's age is #{p.age}")
  end

  def print_name(p) do 
    name = p.first_name <> " " <> p.last_name
    IO.puts("The person's name is #{name}")
  end
end
```

Let's declare some operations for a person represented by the map type. The person has three properties, `first_name`, `last_name` and `age`.

```elixir
iex> person = %{first_name: "Esko", last_name: "Erikoinen", age: 42}
%{age: 42, first_name: "Esko", last_name: "Erikoinen"}

iex> PersonOps.print_age(person)
The person's age is 42
:ok

iex> PersonOps.print_name(person)
The person's name is Esko Erikoinen
:ok
```
You'll notice that the functions perform the actions you expected. A careful reader makes an additional note: now that the `IO.puts\1` is the last value of the expression declared in the function body, in addition to the `:stdout` output the function returns the atom `:ok` indicating a succesful I/O operation.

Repeat after me: everything is an expression, and every expression evaluates to a value.

In Elixir everything is an expression, as in everything has an identifiable value.

## <a name="recursion"></a> Recursion

<div class="key-concept">
![Key concept][lambda]<span>Recursion is looping</span>
<p>Recursion plays an important part in functional programming. Recursion is equivalent to looping, so expect to see no `for` or `while` loops when looking at functionally written code. Expect to see and use lots and lots of recursion when programming in Elixir.</p>

<p>Recursive function is a function that calculates it's final value by repeated application of the function - in other words - function calling itself over and over again. If you do not understand recursion is, read this paragraph again.</p>

<p> Playing with recursion in imperative languages feels somewhat having a conversation with your Australian cousin. The language is fun and refreshing for a while, but you usually want to go back to speaking real English after a while. In the end, recursion is no different from using `for` or `while` loops.</p>
</div>

```java
static int factorial(int n) {
    if(n < 2) {
        return n;
    }
    int res = 1;
    while(n > 1) {
        res = n * res;
        n--;
    }
    return res;
}

```

The above is an example of an imperative approach to the commonly implemented factorial function. The function first checks if the input parameter is valid for calculating factorial and then loops the following: multiply the integer `res` with the input number `n` and decrement `n` while `n` has a value over `1`.

```elixir
defmodule MathEx do
  def fact(n) do
    if(n < 2) do
      n
    else
      n * fact(n-1)
    end
  end
end
```

The factorial function can be easily re-written to use a recursive approach. The principle of operation is the same, if `n < 2`, return `n`. Otherwise  multiply `n` with the result of the function `fact(n-1)`.

```elixir
# When called, the function expands as follows:

iex> MathEx.fact(5)
    --> 5 * fact(4)
    --> 5 * 4 * fact(3)
    --> 5 * 4 * 3 * fact(2)
    --> 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * fact(1) # Recursion-terminating return value of fact(1)
    --> 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
120
```

It is always important to have a terminating condition for recursion (`n < 2`) otherwise the recursive function will call itself indefinitely, eventually resulting in a stack overflow.

```elixir
defmodule ListOps do
  def list_length([]) do
    0
  end

  def list_length([head|tail]) do
    1 + list_length(tail)
  end
end

iex> ListOps.list_length([1,2,3,4,5])
5
```

Here we already play with a new concept called pattern matching, which we will discuss in more detail in a later chapter.

We defined a module `ListOps` with a two variants of the function `list_length/1`. The first variant accepts a pattern matching an empty list. The pattern matching is also used in the function parameters with the syntax `[head|tail]` to extract the head element from the tail of the list, as introduced in the lists-chapter earlier. 

The second variant accepts a pattern for a non-empty list. Remember that the function `hd\1`, which the syntax used maps to, raises an exception for an empty list, so an empty list does not match the pattern provided.

The former variant of `list_length/1` returns a zero for an empty list, and the latter adds the result of a recursive call to `list_length/1` with the number one.

```elixir
# When called, the function expands as follows:

iex> ListOps.list_length([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    --> 1 + list_length([2, 3, 4, 5])
    --> 1 + 1 + list_length([3, 4, 5]) 
    --> 1 + 1 + 1 + list_length([4, 5])
    --> 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + list_length([5])
    --> 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + list_length([]) # The recursion terminates and returns a zero
    --> 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0
5
```

The expansion of the `list_length/1` behaves quite similarily to the factorial function.

```java
int[] array = {1,2,3,4,5};

static int[] squareArray(int[] array) {  
    int[] result = new int[array.length];

    for(int i = 0 ; i < ; array.length ; ++i) {
        result[i] = array[i] * array[i];
    }

    return result;
}

int[] result = squareArray(array); // Yields an array of {1, 4, 9, 16, 25};

```

The Java code above represents a simple algorithm filling a result array with the squared values of the input array. Let's make a recursive rewrite of the function:

```elixir
defmodule ListOps do
  def square_list([]) do
    []
  end
  def square_list([head|tail]) do
    [head*head | square_list(tail)]
  end
end

iex> ListOps.square_list([1,2,3,4,5])
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

Defining functions with multiple patterns is common practice in Elixir programming. The idea is to rule out cases on as high a level as possible, leaving the function with less clutter, so they can focus on expressing their behavior instead of performing checks on their inputs.

The latter definition of `square_list/1` multiplies the head of the list with itself, and prepends the result to the result produced by a recursive call to the same function `square_list/1`. The recursive call can now match against either of the functions by the same name.

```elixir
defmodule ListOps do
  def reverse([]) do
    []
  end

  def reverse([head|tail]) do
    reverse(tail) ++ [head]
  end
end

iex> ListOps.reverse([1,2,3,4,5])
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

The position of the recursive call sometimes has a significant effect on the result of recursion. As an example of this we define a new function `reverse/1` that accepts two patterns, either an empty list `[]` or a list with at least the `head` element present. The both the `head` and the `tail` are extracted from the pattern `[head|tail]`. The head is then prepended with the result of a recursive call to `reverse/1` applied to the lists tail. As a result the function `reverse/1` produces us a reversed copy of the list.

```elixir
iex> ListOps.reverse([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    --> reverse([2, 3, 4, 5]) ++ [1]
    --> reverse([3, 4, 5]) ++ [2] ++ [1]
    --> reverse([4, 5]) ++ [3] ++ [2] ++ [1]
    --> reverse([5]) ++ [4] ++ [3] ++ [2] ++ [1]
    --> reverse([]) ++ [5] ++ [4] ++ [3] ++ [2] ++ [1] # The recursion terminates and returns an empty list
    --> [] ++ [5] ++ [4] ++ [3] ++ [2] ++ [1]
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

The expansion of the `reverse/1` differs slightly from the earlier functions, but in principle works in a same way. The main difference is, that the the extracted `head` value is kept on the right-hand side of the join `++` operator. When prepended, the empty result from the call of `reverse([])` does not add in item to the front of the resulting list. 

## <a name="tail_call_optimization"></a> Tail call optimization
<div class="key-concept">
![Key concept][lambda]<span>Tail call optimization</span>
<p>The function we defined does not come without problems. The Elixir compiler supports a feature called *tail call optimization* (or tail call elimination) for recursive functions. Tail call optimization refers to the elimination of the actual recursive call in favor of transforming the recursive calls in to a loop.</p>

<p>The optimization is a significant performance improvement over recursion. After the transformation the virtual machine does not need to allocate a new call stack to the successive recursive function calls, but can instead reuse the original stack created during the initial function call.</p>

<p>The condition for the tail call optimization to be applied is to formulate the recursive call so that the final, recursion-terminating call does not need any values from the previous function calls.</p>
</div>

```elixir
defmodule ArrayOps do
  def square_list(list) do
    do_squaring([], list)
  end

  defp do_squaring(acc, []) do 
    acc
  end

  defp do_squaring(acc, [head|tail]) do
    do_squaring([head*head | acc], tail)
end

iex> ArrayOps.square_list [1,2,3,4,5]
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

The rewritten `square_list\1` uses a helper function to enable the elimination of the call stack creation. Creating a private helper function `do_squaring/2` within the module allows for the original call syntax for the users' of the function.

`do_squaring/2` takes two parameters, an accumulator list that holds the squared values and the list with the values to square. The function iterates over the list element-by-element, and finally when the list runs out of elements, the `do_squaring/2` returns the accumulated value.

```elixir
defmodule MathEx do
  def fact(n) do
    if(n < 2) do
      n
    else
      n * fact(n-1)
    end
  end
end
```

Let's visit again the earlier example of the `fact/1` function. We also showed how the calls of the function rolled out. It's important to realize, that our implementation of `fact/1` is not tail-recursive, as the expression `n * fact(n-1)` cannot release the call stack, but expects a return value from the successive call on each iteration. Let's remedy the situation.

```elixir
defmodule MathEx do
  def fact_rec(n), do: do_fact(n, n)

  defp do_fact(n, 1) do
    n
  end

  defp do_fact(acc, n) do
    m = n - 1
    do_fact(acc * m, m)
  end
end
```

We achieve the tail-recursiveness by implementing a helper function `do_fact/2` accepting to parameters, the accumulated state `acc` and the number `n` acting as the multiplier. The first call to `do_fact/2` assigns the initial parameter `n` as the accumulator `acc` and on each call to `do_fact/2` the `n` is subtracted by 1 to obtain a new multiplier. The recursion-terminates, when `n` reaches the number 1 and the accumulated value is returned.

```elixir
iex> MathEx.fact(5)
120

# What happens in the function is:

iex> MathEx.fact(5)
    --> do_fact(5, 5)  
    --> do_fact(20, 4)
    --> do_fact(60, 3)
    --> do_fact(120, 1) # Call matches the terminating pattern
120
```

The tail-recursive variant of `fact/1` passes the state of calculation between the function calls, and the calls are optimized to an iterative loop by the compiler. The previous call stack is re-used between successive function calls. As a wrap up, elimination of tail-recursion allows a function to operate in constant (stack) space.

## Guards in functions

```elixir
defmodule MathEx do
  def fact(n) when (is_number(n) and n > -1) do
    if(n < 2) do
      n
    else
      n * fact(n-1)
    end
  end
end

iex> MathEx.fact("a")
** (FunctionClauseError) no function clause matching in MathEx.fact/1
    iex:75: MathEx.fact("a")

```

The function definitions can also be decorated with guards in order to allow the function to yield safe and predictable results. The factorial function does not work for numbers less than zero so we decorate the function definition with a guard with the `when <cond>` just before the block initiated by the `do` keyword. Our guard makes sure that the function receives a number and the function is of valid magnitude.

## <a name="lambda_functions"></a> λ (lambda) functions 
<div class="key-concept">
![Key concept][lambda]<span>Anonymous functions</span>
<p>The functional programming paradigm has its roots in lambda calculus. Functional language implementations support declaring lambda functions, often with a very efficient syntax. Lambda functions are also called anonymous functions, as they do not have a name associated with them most of the time.</p>

<p>The common use case for lambda functions is as parameters to functions accepting functions. Lambda functions are often treated as throwaway functions to complement the functionality of high order functions, which we will discuss in the next chapter.</p>
</div>

```elixir
iex> mult = fn(a,b) -> a * b end
#Function<12.54118792/2 in :erl_eval.expr/5>
iex> is_function(mult)
true
iex> mult.(3, 5)
15
```

On the first line we match an anonymous function accepting two parameters to a variable. The function just performs a multiplication for the arguments. 

The function is called by applying a the parameters `(3,5)` to the variable associated with the function. Notice that the arguments are separated from the variable by a dot `.` -  which is a requirement for calling anonymous functions in the case they get assigned to a variable.

Unlike regular functions, anonymous functions can be declared outside a module.

```elixir
iex> foo = "bar"
"bar"
iex> (fn -> foo = "quux" end).()
"quux"
iex>
"bar"
```

Lambda functions are closures, and such they have a private scope that only the anonymous function can access. Any variable declared within the scope of an anonymous function does not affect the higher level environment.

Like any other function or expression, the lambda function evaluates to the value returned by that expression.

## Functions as function parameters

One of the more interesting features of functional languages is the ability to use functions (typically lambda functions) as parameters to functions generalizing some sort of behavior. Let's take a look at some examples. 

```elixir
iex> defmodule ListOps do
       def my_map([], _) do
         []
       end
       def my_map([head|tail], fun) do
         [fun.(head)] ++ my_map(tail, fun)
       end
     end
```

Let's use the module `ListOps` as a container for some generalized operations for lists. We start by defining a function called `my_map/2`. `my_map/2` is generalizes a behavior of iterating through a list of items, applying a function for each element and returning a new copy of a list with those items as a a result.

The first parameter is a list, for which we provide two patterns for. The first pattern matches an empty list `[]` and "some value". The pattern returns an empty list `[]` and effectively ignores both parameters.

The second pattern matches a list with at least one element and applies the function `fun` received as a second parameter. It creates a new list from the `head` element of the list with the `fun` applied by calling `fun.(head)` and prepends the result to a list received by a successive call to `my_map` with the list's `tail` and `fun` as it's parameters. 

```elixir
iex> ListOps.my_map([1,2,3,4,5], fn n -> n * 2 end)
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
iex> ListOps.my_map([1,2,3,4,5], fn n -> n * n end)
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

The function `my_map` is already proving itself really hand by allowing us to abstract away the tedious and labory iteration of lists. The anonymous function `fn/1` accepted by `my_map` is the one that is used to define the functions behavior within the iterative calls.

```elixir
iex> ListOps.my_map(["jack", "of", "all", "trades"], fn str -> String.upcase(str) end)
["JACK", "OF", "ALL", "TRADES"]
```

We did not use any function guards, so the map can be used for different kinds of lists. 

```elixir
iex> ListOps.map([1,2,3,4,5], fn 
  n when rem(n, 2) == 0 -> div(n, 2)
  n -> n * 2
  end)
[2, 1, 6, 2, 10]
```

As a cherry on top, Elixir also allows us to match patterns from within anonymous functions. We define two patterns for the `fn/1` which uses a guard in the first pattern the check if the remained from the `rem(n, 2)` is zero indicating the number is an odd number. Those numbers are divided by two. The second pattern multiplies the odd numbers we supplied.

The possibility to accept functions as function parameters proves itself a really powerful way of creating complex abstractions with a very little code time after time. The functionality implemented here is in reality provided by the [Enum module](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Enum.html). It's an uncommon case that a common behavior such as the one presented above needs to implemented by the programmer. Now that we've gotten our hands dirty with functions and their behavior, let's take a look at some of the commonly used functions provided by the Elixir API.

    ![Key concept][lambda]<span>Laziness as a virtue</span>
    <p>In addition to lists Elixir provides a list-like structure called a stream. The stream is a lazily evulated counterpart of a list. The laziness means, that after declaration, the value of a list is not necessarily evaluated immediately, but will be accessible when some eager function requires it.</p>
